# artifucktory
a very very little script to manage the migration of artifacts from a JFrog Artifactory Repository to another JFrog Artifactory repository.

Once upon a time, we used to have a local JFrog Artifactory repository, but one day, suddenly, my boss told me to setup a JFrog Artifactory server on the cloud, because some outsourcing developers should had to use it. 
I've found very good the Artifactory Cloud Saas, but when i've tried to migrate the internal repository into the cloud... NOPE.

We have so little time to do this migration that i'm started to arguing with Artifactory REST API, and ten minutes later, i've done the seed of this script.
